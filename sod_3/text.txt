Would they else be content to die?
Tongue-tied, our queen?
 You'll stay?
Nay, but you will?
 Will you go yet?
 How say you?
My prisoner?
 or my guest?
You were pretty lordings then?
The verier wag o' the two?
Is he won yet?
Never?
 have I twice said well?
 when was't before?
What was my first?
But once before I spoke to the purpose: when?
Art thou my boy?
smutch'd thy nose?
Art thou my calf?
 Can thy dam?
--may't be?
Communicatest with dreams;--how can this be?
What means Sicilia?
What cheer?
 how is't with you, best brother?
Are you moved, my lord?
Will you take eggs for money?
Do seem to be of ours?
We are yours i' the garden: shall's attend you there?
 What, Camillo there?
Didst note it?
Didst perceive it?
That he did stay?
By any understanding pate but thine?
But of the finer natures?
Of head-piece extraordinary?
Perchance are to this business purblind?
Ay, but why?
My wife is slippery?
Is whispering nothing?
Is leaning cheek to cheek?
 is meeting noses?
Kissing with inside lip?
Of laughing with a sigh?
Of breaking honesty--horsing foot on foot?
Skulking in corners?
 wishing clocks more swift?
Hours, minutes?
 noon, midnight?
That would unseen be wicked?
 is this nothing?
Who does infect her?
Without ripe moving to't?
 Would I do this?
Could man so blench?
What case stand I in?
 Not speak?
What is the news i' the court?
 Do you know, and dare not?
By whom, Camillo?
For what?
How should this grow?
Shall I be your playfellow?
Why, my sweet lord?
And why so, my lord?
Who taught you this?
What colour are your eyebrows?
What wisdom stirs amongst you?
Merry or sad shall't be?
Was he met there?
 his train?
 Camillo with him?
So easily open?
What is this?
 sport?
Shall I be heard?
Who is't that goes with me?
 lack I credit?
Our forceful instigation?
How could that be?
 Have I done well?
What dost thou then in prison?
You know me, do you not?
To see her women?
 any of them?
 Emilia?
How fares our gracious lady?
A boy?
 Who's there?
My lord?
How does the boy?
Than the queen's life?
What noise there, ho?
What, canst not rule her?
Will you not push her out?
Where were her life?
 What needs these hands?
My child?
And call me father?
To save this brat's life?
That I should fear to die?
Hast thou read truth?
What is the business?
What fit is this, good lady?
What studied torments, tyrant, hast for me?
What wheels?
 racks?
 fires?
 what flaying?
 boiling?
In leads or oils?
To taste of thy most worst?
The deserts of Bohemia?
hunt this weather?
 A boy or a child, I wonder?
What, art so near?
ailest thou, man?
Why, boy, how is it?
Name of mercy, when was this, boy?
 What's within, boy?
son?
But shall I go mourn for that, my dear?
 what comes the wool to?
I to buy for our sheep-shearing feast?
this sister of mine do with rice?
pies; mace; dates?
What, by a horseman, or a footman?
 canst stand?
Dost lack any money?
What manner of fellow was he that robbed you?
How do you now?
Shall I bring thee on the way?
Vilely bound up?
 What would he say?
The sternness of his presence?
Do you neglect them?
What, like a corse?
Which dances with your daughter?
 Has he any unbraided wares?
Is there no manners left among maids?
faces?
our guests?
and lost all my money?
What hast here?
 ballads?
Is it true, think you?
 Why should I carry lies abroad?
Is it true too, think you?
Whither?
O, whither?
Whither?
What, neither?
Then whither goest?
 say, whither?
My dainty duck, my dear-a?
Of the new'st and finest, finest wear-a?
Is it not too far gone?
What follows this?
And this my neighbour too?
Say you the like to him?
Have you a father?
I have: but what of him?
Knows he of this?
Of reasonable affairs?
With age and altering rheums?
 can he speak?
 hear?
Know man from man?
 dispute his own estate?
Lies he not bed-rid?
But what he did being childish?
 Will't please you, sir, be gone?
Why look you so upon me?
I think, Camillo?
That I have borne your father?
May this, almost a miracle, be done?
A place whereto you'll go?
Hold up before him?
Yea, say you so?
The medicine of our house, how shall we do?
Who have we here?
 why shakest thou so?
Are you in earnest, sir?
Have you done there?
 whither are you bound?
Are you a courtier, an't like you, sir?
thou not the air of the court in these enfoldings?
hath not my gait in it the measure of the court?
receives not thy nose court-odor from me?
not on thy baseness court-contempt?
business, I am therefore no courtier?
What advocate hast thou to him?
The fardel there?
 what's i' the fardel?
Wherefore that box?
Why, sir?
Think you so, sir?
like you, sir?
capital?
After I have done what I promised?
 Are you a party in this business?
that may turn back to my advancement?
Than to rejoice the former queen is well?
With a sweet fellow to't?
Till his lost child be found?
And begin, 'Why to me?
Never to marry but by my free leave?
What with him?
 What train?
His princess, say you, with him?
 not women?
The adventure of her person?
That noble honour'd lord, is fear'd and loved?
Where's Bohemia?
Who?
 Camillo?
You are married?
Is this the daughter of a king?
Beseech you, sir, were you present at this relation?
The news, Rogero?
 How goes it now, sir?
found his heir?
the meeting of the two kings?
hence the child?
What became of his bark and his followers?
Are they returned to the court?
the rejoicing?
Who would be thence that has the benefit of access?
See you these clothes?
Thou wilt amend thy life?
Not swear it, now I am a gentleman?
How if it be false, son?
Comes it not something near?
For being more stone than it?
What was he that did make it?
Would you not deem it breathed?
Did verily bear blood?
Could ever yet cut breath?
 Shall I draw the curtain?
Is she become the suitor?
Where hast thou been preserved?
 where lived?
Thy father's court?
